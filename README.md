## About the Project
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

This project is run through the command-line and requires inquirer and mysql2 npm packages to connect to the mySQL database and to interact at the CLI as well as the console.table npm to print mySQL rows to the console.
Use npm i in the command-line to install the required packs.


Once the npm packages are installed, begin the process of getting the database set up. Run mysql -u root (or whatever your username is) -p in the main directory and enter your password to connect to mySQL. Use SOURCE db/db.sql then SOURCE db/schema.sql as well as SOURCE db/seeds.sql to get the database set up. Quit out of mySQL by typing quit in the command-line then run node index.js. Follow the prompts/questions asked to make edits to the database.
